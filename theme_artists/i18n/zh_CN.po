"Design expression comes from the combined effect of all elements in a "
"product. Colour tone, shape and size should direct a person's thoughts "
"towards buying the product. Therefore it is in the product designer's best "
"interest to consider the audiences who are most likely to be the product's "
"end consumers. Keeping in mind how consumers will perceive the product "
"during the design process will direct towards the product’s success in the "
"market. However, even within a specific audience, it is challenging to cater"
" to each possible personality within that group."

"The solution to that is to create a product that, in its designed appearance"
" and function, expresses a personality or tells a story. Products that carry"
" such attributes are more likely to give off a stronger expression that will"
" attract more consumers. On that note it is important to keep in mind that "
"design expression does not only concern the appearance of a product, but "
"also its function. For example, as humans our appearance as well as our "
"actions are subject to people's judgment when they are making a first "
"impression of us."
